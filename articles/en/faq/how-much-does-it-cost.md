Guidde started as a subscription service focused on helping small startups/businesses deal with a growing list of (sometimes repetitive) support requests. After a while, it became clear that serving one's customers with well-crafted content about their product could be solved in a simple, decentralized, and affordable way.

From now on, **Guidde is free to use, fork, customize and it will remain like that in the future**.

I hope that, somehow, it will help you build amazing things! If you want to reach out, [let's chat on Twitter](https://twitter.com/diegocouto). ☺️
